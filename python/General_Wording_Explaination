This can be taken as a substitution of python documentation since
I dont wanna write python standard documentation for now.

Tip1: Attribute name "pos" always stands for "position" which is a dictionary that maps nodes onto their
2D coordinates. A "position/pos" determine uniquely the state of a drawing(or everything of a drawing).
So it can also be called position_state in some sense.

Tip2: Our read file only recognize absolute path(on windows). Not sure if this work on linux/mac too(slash
back slash issue). So I put on default file there.
Another way to read files except the default one is to modify hardcoded default file path(copy paste) under
the method "load_file_hard" in Class "Helper"
